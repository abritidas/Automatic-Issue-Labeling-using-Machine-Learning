"__label__bug Jacoco Coverage doesn't meet specified criteria if run in release mode If run in release mode mvn release:prepare -Papache-release,apache coverage requirements are not meet on my M3 macbook (while they seem to work correctly on GitHub actions). This issue is created to track this behaviour. The reason for it is, that if docker is not available (and tests are skipped), the coverage criteria is not meet and the build is failing. This should be fixed for 3.1.1 or 3.2.0. Might be good to just put that into a profile and run that profile in CI only, so we get information about coverage or a failed build but don't get bothered while running a release on a system without docker."
"__label__question WARCHdfsBolt forwarding WARC file path to StatusUpdaterBolt  the WARCHdfsBolt produces a continous stream of records in WARC format. The resulting WARC files are written into e.g. an S3-compliant storage with respect to some RotationPolicy and FilenameFormat. Regarding the Storm topology, the WARCHdfsBolt is a dead-end and is not emitting any tuples. However, we are especially interested in the information, in which file (filename) a certain web page / WARC record is written, and we would like to forward this information to the index, e.g. an OpenSearch/Elasticsearch instance. Is this reasonable and technically possible? Probably only when the WARCHdfsBolt emits the corresponding info to the StatusUpdaterBolt and is not a dead-end anymore."

"__label__question API docs: continue with github pages or use docs.rs? We've discussed this before ( https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto/issues/629 ).  Things that have changed since last discussion:    * [docs.rs supports custom build info](https://github.com/onur/docs.rs/pull/73) so we can specify cargo features for docs.rs to build  * crategen landed so we don't really use features any more, so docs.rs should have up to date docs on our crates    Downsides to using docs.rs:    * AWS service discoverability is lacking.  See https://docs.rs/rusoto_core/0.27.0/rusoto_core/ .  How do you know what services are available?  Compare to our existing github pages link where you can see all the service crates: https://rusoto.github.io/rusoto/rusoto_core/index.html  * Only published crates have docs.  If someone is using `master` instead of a release of Rusoto, they need to generate docs locally    Downsides to continuing to use Github Pages:    * our build times continue to increase    Who's got thoughts?"

"__label__question Question: Rule and Strategy over certain time periods Hi, I'm not sure if the terminology of this question's title is appropriate, so I'll try to explain myself a bit better here.    I want to have a Strategy that tells me whether, in the current month (but could be week or day) the price crossed over the R3 pivot point, and, within the same period, didn't cross below the central pivot.    It seems to me that a Strategy will run rules on each Bar till it encouter one that satisfies the buy Rule, and then runs till it finds a Bar that satisfies the sell Rule. Is this correct? Is Strategy the correct object to use if I only want ""alarms"" (rather than buy/sell signals)?    Also, these checks should be strictly within a certain period. I am not interested in getting an alarm if the R3 is crossed up last month, and central pivot is crossed this month. I only want an alarm if both conditions happen at least once within the same period.    I have now 2 implementation, a brute force one where I manually scan the time series and perform my calculations without making use of Rule or Strategy, and one where I'm trying, so far without success, to fit this algorithm within Strategy/Rule model.    Any hint or opinion would be highly appreciated.    Thanks for this amazing work."
