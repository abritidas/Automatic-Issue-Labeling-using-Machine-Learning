# üöÄ Automatic Issue Labeling using Machine Learning

This project uses traditional Machine Learning (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF) to automatically classify GitHub issue descriptions into one of the three categories: **bug**, **enhancement**, or **question**. It leverages keyword-based open coding and sklearn's text processing tools to train and evaluate the classifier on labeled issue datasets.

## üìå Features

- Automates labeling of GitHub issues into three categories: `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question`
- Applies custom keyword-based open coding for initial label annotation
- Uses Logistic Regression with advanced TF-IDF vectorization (n-grams, token filtering)
- Preprocesses text data using `neattext` for cleaning and stopword removal
- Built with Python 3.10.0 and scikit-learn pipeline for an interpretable, efficient model
- Effective on small or limited datasets without needing extensive manual labeling
- Evaluates Logistic Regression model performance along with LLMs like ChatGPT and Deepseek
- Tested on real-world GitHub issue samples.
